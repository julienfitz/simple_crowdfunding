Simple Crowdfunding
===================

After forking several, more complicated crowdfunding projects, and having what seemed like far too many issues (largely related to how long ago those projects were created), I decided to take matters into my own hands and try to create my own from scratch.

**Why not just use an already-existing crowdfunding site?**

I'm trying to raise funds for a programming-related professional expense, so it seemed only natural that I create my own crowdfunding site from scratch. Besides, it's something I've never done before and seems completely daunting - obviously, I need to do it!

I looked pretty hard at the [Selfstarter](https://github.com/lockitron/selfstarter) code for some of this, so big ups to them!
